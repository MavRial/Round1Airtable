# Round1Airtable

Android app for the **Airtable Round 1 take-home assignment**.

---

## Summary

This project implements a **Timeline UI** in **Jetpack Compose** to display events across multiple days.  
Each event is represented in **swimlanes**, with support for **horizontal** and **vertical scrolling**.

---

## Features

- Events organized in **swimlanes** to avoid overlapping  
- `EventCard` composable for individual events  
- `DaysHeader` displaying dates on top of the timeline  
- **Horizontal and vertical** scrolling using `ScrollState`  
- Sample data (`SampleTimelineItems`) to demonstrate the timeline  
- **Clean and maintainable architecture** using Jetpack Compose and MVVM patterns

## Project Structure

| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `models/Event.kt` | Defines the `Event` data class |
| `timeline/SampleTimelineItems.kt` | Contains sample events and lane assignment logic |
| `timeline/EventCard.kt` | Composable to render a single event card |
| `timeline/TimelineContent.kt` | Composable rendering events in lanes |
| `timeline/DaysHeader.kt` | Displays the days at the top of the timeline |
| `timeline/TimelineScreen.kt` | Main screen integrating all components |

## Time Spent

Approximately 4 hours to implement the basic Timeline UI.
Initial commit timestamp confirms development within the allowed timeframe.

---

## What I Liked

Jetpack Compose made UI layout simple and flexible

Automatic lane assignment for overlapping events

Smooth and responsive scrollable timeline

---

## What I Would Improve

Implement drag-and-drop to change event dates

Add zoom in/out functionality for timeline navigation

Persist events using a backend or local database (Room / Firestore)

---

## Design Decisions

Swimlanes used to avoid overlapping events

ScrollState for both horizontal and vertical scroll handling

MVVM pattern for clean separation between UI and data

Simple Event model with name, startDate, and endDate

---

## Testing

Manually tested with multiple sample events for correct lane assignment

Verified scrolling behavior in both directions
